# Microcaps
No need for manually calculating microcaps when doing research on new coins/tokens

After reading [this article](https://medium.com/@daytradernik/picking-out-microcaps-101-2215a5782691) I decided to create this small app to help me with step 1. Double clicking a row will open the corresponing coin/token page on [coinmarketcap](coinmarketcap.com).

Hope this helps anyone :) 

Any feature requests are welcome!
